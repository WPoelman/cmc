Final project for the course Computer Mediated Communication.

## TODO
In general, keep an eye on the questionnaire results.

- [ ] visualization of `work_tasks` (knowledge areas) and maybe `work_systems`
- [ ] improve visualization of employees and communication tools (reduce edges? matrix?)
- [ ] coding of open question answers (tasks, systems, maybe reason of location preference)
- [ ] find relevant literature (maybe from weekly readings) for visualization ideas and report
- [ ] write report
